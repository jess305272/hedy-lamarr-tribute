      <h4 class="description" id="text-description"><p>Hedy Lamarr, Austrian-American, better known as an actress, but is also the inventor of a radio guidance system for torpedos. Often dubbed “the most beautiful woman in the world”, Lamarr started her career at 17. In 1933, she was noticed internationally for her role in the Czech film <i>Ecstacy (1933)</i>. </p>
        <p>With WWII approaching, she decided to leave her home country to Hollywood. At a dinner party, talking to composer George Antheil, Lamarr came up with the idea of “frequency hopping”; by changing the radio frequencies at the transmission end and the reception end at the same time. Later, Antheirl and Lamarr received a patent for the “Secret Communication System”. The use of their invention was not realized at the time. However, it did become an important concept in developing certain secure communication technologies, such as cellular phones, tax machines, and other wireless tech. Both Antheil and Lamarr received awards for this invention later in 1997.</p></h4>
